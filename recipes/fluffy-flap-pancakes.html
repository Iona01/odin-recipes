        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time. The recipe can be easily adjusted to your dietary needs, too. I have tried many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof!</p>
        <p> A word of caution: they're very filling.</p>
        <p>NB: You can make this with all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour.</p>
        <p>NB: Use dairy-free milk substitutes or water in place of milk if desired.</p>
