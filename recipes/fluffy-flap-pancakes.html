        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time. The recipe can be easily adjusted to your dietary needs, too. I have tried many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof!</p>
        <p> A word of caution: they're very filling.</p>
        <p>NB: You can make this with all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour.</p>
        <p>NB: Use dairy-free milk substitutes or water in place of milk if desired.</p>

            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until no lumps remain. Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto the preheated grill and cook until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
